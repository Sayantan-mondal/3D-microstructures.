This repository contains dual phase, 3D microstructures generated by dream 3D.

The Results file gives the output of the dream 3D files as visualised by paraview.

files named as "single.__ " are for single phase microstructure


files named as "ps.__ " are for precipitation strengthened matrix microstructure



files named as "XX_phase2.__ " are for dual phase microstructures, where XX denotes amount of phase 2.
